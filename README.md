## [Math1] Basic Epidemic Prediction

R<sub>0</sub> describes a mathematically-idealized epidemic course that never occurs in real life.  Nevertheless, it does enable useful and non-obvious predictions about the course.

## [Math2] R<sub>0</sub> vs. R<sub>e</sub> vs. Doubling Time -- Which to Follow during an Epidemic?

Despite all the talk about R<sub>0</sub>, doubling times are easier to understand and more helpful as a basis for decisions.  This powerpoint presentation explains the difference between a number of terms, and shows the graphical relationship between doubling times and the epidemic curve.
